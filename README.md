# Bank Credit
 
 This repository contains data and notebooks that contain the exploratory data analysis and the modeling of whether a bank client satisfies the criteria to take a bank loan or not.

Data is available in three files :

  - American bank data : __Bank_of_America_data.csv__
  - German bank data : __german.data__ and __german.data-numeric__
  - Taiwan bank data : __default of credit card clients.xls__

Each of these banks have their own individual notebook for the analysis and classification.
